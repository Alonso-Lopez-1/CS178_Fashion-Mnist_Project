# CS178_Fashion-Mnist_Project
This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of the Fashion MNIST dataset using a variety of classification techniques. Our goal is to explore and compare the effectiveness of different machine learning models in classifying fashion images.

# Classification Techniques
We apply the following machine learning algorithms to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset:

- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN): A simple, yet powerful instance-based learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the labels of their nearest neighbors.
- Logistic Regression: A linear model used for binary classification that has been extended for multi-class classification in this project.
- Feedforward Neural Network: A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that captures complex patterns in the data through a series of linear and non-linear transformations.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A deep learning model specifically designed for processing and classifying images, leveraging convolutional layers to detect local patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes.

# Project Overview
This project includes the following steps:

- Data Preprocessing: Preparing the Fashion MNIST dataset by normalizing the data and splitting it into training and testing sets.
- Model Implementation: Implementing each classification technique, including tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Performance Evaluation: Comparing the accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics across all models to determine the most effective approach.
- Visualizations: Generating plots and graphs to visualize the model performance and learning curves.
